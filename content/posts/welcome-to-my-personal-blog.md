When you tell people that you have decided to take an extended period of time to go **"travelling"** you are often met with a roll of the eyes: **"What about your career?"**, **"Are you going to party for a full year?"**, **"Ooh are you going to find yourself?"**

There seems to be a lot of misconception about what travelling is and why people do it so we have created this website to share with you our experience. We are not going to tell you that everyone should quit their jobs right now and book the next flight to the other side of the world but just show you why we have chosen to do it ourselves.

Whilst we can't share everything about travelling we have tried to group our reasons into these key categories:
 - [Deepen your Perspective]()
 - [Widen your Experiences]()
 - [Immerse yourself in local Cuisine]()
 - [Learn new Skills]()
 - [Discover intersting Places]()

Everyone has a different experience when they travel and don't claim this is a full list of reasons to do it. In fact, there are some important reasons we missed out since they are harder to share through a blog. But most people who have been travelling would agree that these are some of the key reasons to go and this what we would like to share with you.
