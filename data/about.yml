  This is our blogging website for writing about our explorations around the world. The site is a mixture of useful practical information on the how to's of travelling with more theoretical ideas on our search for peace and happiness. Some of the topics we would like to share are recipes from around the world, places to eat, hiking and traveling tips, amazing experiences, sustainability tips, our thoughts on the way the world works and our personal search for happiness.

bioTitle: Hi guys, what's up?
bioDescription: >
  We are a couple who met in Australia whilst travelling. Lulu is Italian and she is passionate about travelling, videography and photograpy. Matt is a data scientist who loves coding and building websites, like this one :)


  After Austrlia, we moved back to the UK for two years where we lived in Edinbrugh and picked up city jobs. We started to feel sucked in by the city lifestyle - we prioritised comfort over fulfilment, we were less peaceful and more stressed and we started to find it more and more difficult not to attach ourselves to day to day frustrations.


  We decided to go travelling again and that this time we would like to share the experience with others. We hope this website is useful for anyone who is interested in travelling or would like to find out more about the world!
