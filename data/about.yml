bioTitle: Hi guys, what's up?
bioDescription: >
  We met in Australia while we were both travelling. Lulu is Italian she is passionate about travelling, videography and photograpy. 
  Matt is a data scientist who loves coding and building websites, like this one :) 


  After Austrlia, we moved back to the UK for two years where we lived in the city and picked up regular jobs. We started to feel sucked in by the city lifestyle - we prioritised comfort over fulfilment, less peaceful and more stressed, more effected by day to day frustrations with less ability to observe.


  We decided to go travelling again and we would like to share our experience ...
